  :indexed-by can take two forms:
  1. A vector of sets:
     In this form, the indexes used will be the cartesian product of the sets
  2. A set of vectors
     In this form, the indexed used will be whatever is in the set.
     Every index should probably have the same length for this to work right.
  
  The :value, :lower, :upper, and :fixed parts can support three
  different forms:

  1. If it's a map, it is taken to be a map from an index to a value
     There's a special case where the index always has one element,
     so you can write:
     {:x {:indexed-by [#{:a :b}] :value {:a 1 :b 2}}}
     and
     {:x {:indexed-by [#{:a :b} #{:c :d}] :value {[:a :c] 1 [:b :c] 2, ...}}}
     point being in the first case we have written :a rather than [:a].
  2. If it's fn?, it's called with the index as its arguments
  3. Otherwise it's taken as a constant and repeated everywhere
